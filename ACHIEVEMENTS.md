## 📅 Chronological Achievements

### June 22, 2025
- ✅ **Auto-Scanner Control and Selective Assignment System**: Complete auto-scanner infrastructure overhaul with intelligent face recognition controls
  - **Achievement**: Implemented comprehensive auto-scanner control interface with pause/resume/status capabilities
  - **Control Interface**: RESTful endpoints for auto-scanner management (`/api/auto-scanner/status`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/check`)
  - **State Management**: File-based control state with graceful pause/resume functionality
  - **Configuration System**: New `autoScanner` config section with dedicated settings separate from manual workflow
  - **Selective Assignment**: Auto-assignment only for previously trained people with ≥90% confidence (vs 70% manual threshold)
  - **Training Requirements**: Only assigns faces to people who have manual training data uploaded to CompreFace
  - **Assignment Tracking**: Uses `assigned_by: 'auto_scanner'` to differentiate from manual (`'user'`) and background (`'auto_recognition'`) assignments
  - **Safe Defaults**: Reduced batch size from 500→10 and interval from 60→300 seconds to prevent overwhelming
  - **Shell Script Integration**: Auto-scanner service checks control state before processing each batch
  - **Root Cause Resolution**: Fixed the core issue of excessive auto-assignments (Margaret: 2,304 faces → now selective)
  - **Files**: `services/api/resolvers/auto-scanner.ts`, `config/defaults.json`, `services/auto-scanner/auto-scanner.sh`, `services/api/util/process-source.ts`
