interface PhotoAPI {
  // Gallery browsing
  getGallery(page: number, limit: number): Promise<GalleryResponse>;
  
  // Photo details
  getPhoto(id: string): Promise<Photo>;
  
  // Search functionality
  searchPhotos(query: SearchQuery): Promise<Photo[]>;
  
  // Person management
  getPersons(): Promise<Person[]>;
  assignFace(faceId: string, personId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Processing status
  getProcessingStatus(): Promise<ProcessingStatus>;
}
```

### Data Models

```typescript
interface Photo {
  id: string;
  filename: string;
  dateTaken?: string;
  fileSize: number;
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
  faces?: Face[];
  objects?: DetectedObject[];
  location?: GPSLocation;
  thumbnailUrl: string;
  fullUrl: string;
}

interface Person {
  id: string;
  name?: string;
  photoCount: number;
  lastSeen?: string;
  confidence?: number;
}

interface ProcessingStatus {
  queueSize: number;
  processing: Photo[];
  recentlyCompleted: Photo[];
  errors: ProcessingError[];
}
```
