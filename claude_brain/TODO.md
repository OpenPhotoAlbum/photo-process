# Claude Brain Testing - Progress Tracking

## Current Status: Starting Phase 1 Testing
- ✅ Brain system built with usage tracking
- ✅ Safety filters configured (.brainignore)
- ✅ Cost estimation tools created
- ✅ System copied to photo-process project
- ✅ OpenAI account funded ($10)
- ✅ System configured for cheapest model (text-embedding-3-small)
- ⏳ **NEXT:** Test on single directory first

## Project Overview
- **Target Project:** `/mnt/hdd/photo-process/` (photo processing platform)
- **Project Size:** 389 code files, ~67,667 lines
- **Estimated Cost:** $0.02-0.05 for full filtered project
- **API Key Status:** Available (quota exceeded on current key)

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Small Safe Test ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Set up OpenAI account with minimal budget ($10)
- ✅ Test on single directory first: `/services/api`
- ✅ Verify cost tracking works correctly  
- ✅ Validate .brainignore filtering
- ✅ **Results:** 14 files → 416 chunks → 140,192 tokens → $0.0028
- ✅ **Search quality:** Excellent - found relevant database and API code

### Phase 2: Expand Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- ⚠️ `/shared` utilities (empty directory)
- ✅ Add `/platform-tools` (47 files, $0.0013)
- ✅ Test cross-directory search functionality
- ✅ Measure search quality vs cost
- ✅ **Results:** 61 total files, $0.0041 combined cost, excellent search quality

### Phase 3: Full Integration
- [ ] Process entire filtered project
- [ ] Generate comprehensive CLAUDE.md files
- [ ] Test with real Claude coding sessions
- [ ] Document workflow for future use

## Safety Measures Implemented
- ✅ `.brainignore` excludes sensitive files, logs, images, node_modules
- ✅ Preview mode shows exactly what files would be processed
- ✅ Real-time token counting and cost estimation
- ✅ Session-by-session usage tracking with detailed reports

## Key Commands Ready
```bash
# Preview what would be processed (safe, no API calls)
python3 claude_brain.py preview /mnt/hdd/photo-process/services/api

# Small test (estimate: $0.001-0.005)
python3 claude_brain.py ingest /mnt/hdd/photo-process/services/api --no-recursive

# Check costs after any operation
python3 claude_brain.py usage

# Search test
python3 claude_brain.py search "database connection" -n 3
```

## Notes for Session Continuity
- Brain system location: `/mnt/hdd/photo-process/claude_brain_initial_version/`
- Project copy location: `/mnt/hdd/photo-process/claude_brain/`
- Virtual environment: `claude_brain_env/`
- Usage log: `usage_log.json` (tracks all costs)

## OpenAI Account Setup (Pending)
- Recommended: $5-10 initial budget
- Use text-embedding-3-small model (5x cheaper)
- Set usage alerts at $2, $5 levels
