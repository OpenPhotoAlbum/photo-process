# Claude Brain Roadmap

## Current Status: Production Ready (v1.0)
- âœ… Core embedding system with SQLite storage
- âœ… Multi-language file processing (Python, JS/TS, Markdown, etc.)
- âœ… Smart text chunking with code-aware boundaries
- âœ… Batch processing for cost efficiency
- âœ… Real-time usage tracking and cost estimation
- âœ… Safety filtering with .brainignore system
- âœ… CLI interface with preview, ingest, and search commands
- âœ… Production validation on real codebases

## Phase 2: Enhanced Integration (v1.1)

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration ðŸŽ¯
**Priority: High**
- Develop MCP server to expose Claude Brain as a tool for Claude Code
- Enable automatic semantic search within Claude sessions
- Eliminate manual copy-paste workflow
- Provide seamless context retrieval during coding

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement MCP server protocol
- Create search tool interface for Claude Code
- Add real-time indexing updates
- Handle concurrent search requests

### Improved Context Management
- **Auto-updating indexes:** Watch filesystem for changes and re-index modified files
- **Project-aware search:** Scope searches to specific directories or file types
- **Context ranking:** Improve relevance scoring with file recency and project structure
- **Chunking improvements:** Better boundary detection for functions, classes, and modules

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (v1.2)

### Enhanced Search Capabilities
- **Multi-modal search:** Support code + documentation + comments in unified queries
- **Contextual search:** "Find similar patterns to this code snippet"
- **Temporal search:** "Show me recent changes related to authentication"
- **Cross-project search:** Index and search across multiple related projects

### Developer Experience
- **VS Code extension:** Direct integration with popular IDEs
- **Git integration:** Track and search code changes over time
- **Team sharing:** Shared indexes for team knowledge bases
- **Search analytics:** Track what developers search for most

## Phase 4: AI-Powered Features (v2.0)

### Intelligent Code Understanding
- **Code relationship mapping:** Understand dependencies and call graphs
- **Pattern detection:** Automatically identify common patterns and anti-patterns
- **Documentation generation:** Auto-generate summaries from code patterns
- **Refactoring suggestions:** Find code duplication and suggest improvements

### Advanced Integration
- **Claude workflow automation:** Automatically provide context for common tasks
- **Learning system:** Improve search quality based on developer feedback
- **Custom embeddings:** Fine-tune embeddings for domain-specific code
- **Multi-language support:** Expand beyond current 12 supported file types

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Incremental indexing:** Only re-process changed files
- **Vector database migration:** Consider specialized vector stores (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Caching improvements:** Better embedding cache management
- **Parallel processing:** Multi-threaded file processing

### Robustness
- **Error recovery:** Better handling of corrupted indexes
- **Backup and restore:** Index backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Migration tools:** Upgrade paths for schema changes
- **Health monitoring:** System health checks and diagnostics

## Target Timelines

- **Phase 2 (MCP Integration):** 2-4 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** 1-2 months  
- **Phase 4 (AI-Powered Features):** 3-6 months

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** Number of projects using Claude Brain
- **Efficiency:** Token savings in Claude sessions
- **Quality:** Search result relevance scores
- **Performance:** Index build times and search latency
- **Integration:** MCP tool usage frequency
