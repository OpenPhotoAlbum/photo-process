“OurKin is ready — a private home for our family’s memories”

**Body:**

Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on something very special for our family — and it’s ready.

🖼 **What is OurKin?**  
OurKin is a private, safe, and beautiful place for us to preserve, organize, and share our family’s photos and stories. It’s completely under our control — no companies, no subscriptions, no social media.

✅ See photos from across generations  
✅ Find people automatically using face recognition  
✅ Organize events, travels, and special moments  
✅ Build a family timeline we can pass down for generations  
✅ Know that everything is safely stored on our own system

This is *our* digital heirloom. Fully private. Fully owned by our family.

**A note from me:**  
This is my way of ensuring that our family’s story is never lost, no matter how technology changes. I hope it brings joy, connection, and maybe even some nostalgia to all of us.

If you have any questions or want help uploading your own old photos, I’m happy to help.

Welcome to **OurKin — The Private Family Cloud.**

With love,  
[Your Name]
