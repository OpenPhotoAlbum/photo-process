## About OurKin

Every family has a story worth preserving.

In a world where most of our photos live scattered across phones, clouds, and social media, itâ€™s easy for precious moments to get lost or forgotten. At the same time, handing over our memories to big corporations never quite felt right.

**OurKin was created to give families complete ownership of their stories.**

With OurKin, your family has its own private digital home â€” a place to organize generations of photos, see where your loved ones have been, track lifeâ€™s special milestones, and build a visual legacy that can be passed down for years to come.

### Our Values

- ðŸ”’ **Privacy First:** Your familyâ€™s data stays with you.
- ðŸ§¬ **Built for Generations:** A true digital heirloom.
- ðŸ“¦ **Fully Owned:** No subscriptions, no hidden fees.
- ðŸ•° **Lifeâ€™s Journey, Preserved:** Organize, search, and revisit precious moments easily.
- ðŸ¤– **Smart Organization:** AI-powered face recognition and smart albums â€” but always fully private.

### Why We Exist

> *Because the most precious things in life deserve to be fully ours.*

OurKin isnâ€™t a product weâ€™re selling. Itâ€™s a long-term gift for our family.

This is our story, beautifully preserved.
