# Mobile App Development Setup - COMPLETED âœ…

## What We've Built

### âœ… Expo TypeScript Project
- React Native app with TypeScript support
- Minimal single photo display from your photo processing API
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Mobile-optimized UI with photo metadata display

### âœ… Development Workflow
- Linux â†’ Mac â†’ iPhone pipeline established
- Rsync-based sync for rapid iteration
- Sync script (`sync-to-mac.sh`) for easy code transfer
- Documentation and README

## Next Steps (for you to complete on Mac)

### 1. Mac Network Setup
Run these commands on your Mac to get ready:

```bash
# Find your Mac's IP address
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
# Example output: inet 192.168.1.105

# Install development tools (if not already installed)
brew install node watchman
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Enable SSH (if not already enabled)
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
```

### 2. Update IP Address
```bash
# Update the sync script with your Mac's info
vim /mnt/hdd/photo-process/services/mobile-app/sync-to-mac.sh
# Change: MAC_IP="192.168.1.XXX" to your actual IP

# Update the app with your Mac's IP  
vim /mnt/hdd/photo-process/services/mobile-app/App.tsx
# Change: const API_BASE = 'http://192.168.1.XXX:9000'
```

### 3. First Sync and Test
```bash
# From Linux: sync to Mac
cd /mnt/hdd/photo-process/services/mobile-app
./sync-to-mac.sh

# On Mac: run the app
npx expo start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app on iPhone
```

### 4. Expected Result
- App loads on your iPhone via Expo Go
- Shows "Loading photo..." then displays a real photo from your server
- Photo metadata appears at bottom (filename, date, face/object counts)
- If errors occur, helpful debugging messages are shown

## Development Ready State

**Linux Side:**
- âœ… Photo processing server running and tested (270+ photos)
- âœ… Mobile app code structure created
- âœ… Sync workflow established

**Mac Side (to complete):**
- [ ] Install Expo CLI and development tools
- [ ] Update IP addresses in code and sync script
- [ ] Test first sync and app launch on iPhone

**iPhone Side:**
- [ ] Install Expo Go from App Store
- [ ] Connect to same WiFi as Mac and Linux machines
- [ ] Test app by scanning QR code

## Current App Features

- Fetches one photo from `/api/gallery?limit=1`
- Displays photo full-screen with metadata overlay
- Shows filename, date taken, face count, object count
- Comprehensive error handling with debugging hints
- TypeScript interfaces matching your API responses

## Ready for Phase 1 Development

Once the basic app is working, we can rapidly add:
- Photo grid with infinite scroll
- Search functionality
- Person management integration
- Processing status monitoring
- "Recently processed" views

The foundation is solid and ready for rapid iteration! ðŸš€
