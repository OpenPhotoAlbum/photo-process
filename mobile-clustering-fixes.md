# Mobile App Clustering Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Face Images Not Rendering (Blank Circles)
**Problem**: Face images were showing as blank circles because the placeholder had `zIndex: -1`, putting it behind the image. When images failed to load, nothing was visible.

**Fix**: 
- Restructured the image layering so placeholder is visible by default
- Added proper Ionicons person icon as placeholder
- Fixed z-index layering issues
- Made placeholder background color more visible (#e0e0e0)

### 2. Image URL Path Issue
**Problem**: Face images were using incorrect API path `/api/media/face/` instead of `/media/face/`

**Fix**: Updated all Image source URIs from:
```javascript
`http://192.168.40.6:9000/api/media/face/${faceId}`
```
to:
```javascript
`http://192.168.40.6:9000/media/face/${faceId}`
```

### 3. UI Styling for Embedded Mode
**Problem**: Dark background and white text made the UI hard to read in embedded mode

**Fix**:
- Changed embedded container background from black to light gray (#f5f5f5)
- Updated embedded header to have white background with proper borders
- Fixed text colors for better contrast

### 4. Individual Face Interaction
**Problem**: Couldn't click on individual faces in the cluster grid

**Fix**: Made each face in the grid individually clickable with TouchableOpacity wrapper

## Key Changes Made

1. **UnknownClustersScreen.tsx**:
   - Fixed image placeholder layering and styling
   - Corrected face image API endpoints
   - Added TouchableOpacity to individual faces in clusters
   - Improved embedded mode styling
   - Added better error handling for image loading

2. **Face Image Component Structure**:
   ```javascript
   <View style={styles.faceImageWrapper}>
     <View style={styles.faceImagePlaceholder}>
       <Ionicons name="person" size={30} color="#999" />
     </View>
     <Image
       source={{ uri: `http://192.168.40.6:9000/media/face/${faceId}` }}
       style={styles.faceImage}
       onError={(e) => { console.log('Error:', e.nativeEvent.error); }}
     />
   </View>
   ```

## Testing Notes

After these changes:
- Face images should display properly with person icon placeholders
- Individual faces in clusters are clickable
- UI should be readable in embedded mode within the Faces tab
- API should properly serve face images from `/media/face/:faceId` endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Test the changes in the mobile app
2. Verify face images are loading correctly
3. Check that clustering navigation works properly
4. Consider adding actual functionality to face clicks (assignment, detail view, etc.)
