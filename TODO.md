# Platform TODO List

This file tracks current development priorities and tasks for the Photo Management Platform.

## üî• High Priority

### üñºÔ∏è Backend Image Performance Optimization
- [x] Fix thumbnail generation returning 500 errors on `?thumb=1` requests ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Mobile app was not using thumbnail URLs from API
  - ‚úÖ **Solution**: Updated App.tsx to use `item.thumbnail_url` instead of `item.media_url`  
  - ‚úÖ **Testing**: Verified thumbnail generation works correctly with Sharp library
  - ‚úÖ **Performance**: Improved from 2-10MB images to ~7KB thumbnails
- [ ] Implement multiple image sizes for different use cases
  - [ ] Thumbnail size (256x256) for grid views
  - [ ] Medium size (800px wide) for mobile viewing
  - [ ] Full size for detailed viewing/zooming
- [ ] Add proper CDN-style caching headers
  - [ ] Set appropriate Cache-Control headers
  - [ ] Add ETag support for efficient caching
  - [ ] Configure expires headers
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading
  - [ ] Serve low-resolution placeholder first
  - [ ] Load high-resolution on demand

### üõ†Ô∏è Platform Development

- [ ] Build React frontend in services/web-app/ with TypeScript (lower priority - mobile first)
- [ ] Fix remaining platform tools that have config manager import issues

## üìã Medium Priority

### üîß Technical Improvements
- [ ] Add linting setup and configuration for the platform
- [ ] Add comprehensive API error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement advanced search with filters for objects, faces, dates
- [ ] Add smart album auto-generation based on content analysis
- [ ] Optimize face clustering to use CompreFace recognition for better accuracy

## üìù Notes

- **Documentation Priority**: Always keep documentation website updated with any platform changes
- **Config Issues**: Many platform tools need migration from build imports to direct knex configuration
- **Testing**: Unit test suite is fully functional (93/93 tests passing)
- **Architecture**: Successfully migrated from legacy monolith to platform microservices

## üìù Development Notes

### Mobile Development Strategy
- **Vision Alignment**: Following VISION.md Phase 1 (Trust & Reliability) with mobile-first approach
- **Development Workflow**: Linux desktop for coding + Mac for iOS building via rsync
