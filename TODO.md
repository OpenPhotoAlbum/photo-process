# Platform TODO List

This file tracks current development priorities and tasks for the Photo Management Platform.

## üî• High Priority

### ‚úÖ Documentation Website
- [x] Generate documentation website using Docusaurus
- [x] Set up basic structure and navigation
- [x] Copy existing documentation into proper format
- [x] Configure for Photo Management Platform branding
- [x] Install advanced plugins (OpenAPI, Mermaid diagrams)
- [x] Restructure into logical documentation "books"
  - [x] Getting Started section (intro, installation)
  - [x] User Guide section (photo management with AI features)
  - [x] Configuration guides (environment, database)
  - [x] Development documentation (setup, workflow, architecture)
  - [x] Deployment guides (Docker, manual, production)
  - [x] API Reference section
- [x] Add interactive features:
  - [x] Tabbed content for different deployment methods
  - [x] Admonitions (tips, warnings, info callouts)
  - [x] Live code examples with syntax highlighting
  - [x] Architecture diagrams with Mermaid
  - [x] Multi-level navigation with emojis
  - [x] Advanced plugins (Mermaid diagrams)
- **Status**: Basic site complete, advanced features in progress - Running at http://localhost:3000/

### üîç Training Management Endpoints
- [ ] Investigate Training Management endpoints - at least one is broken
- [ ] Clarify purpose of training management system
- [ ] Fix broken endpoints and improve error handling
- **Purpose**: Training Management handles CompreFace face recognition model training:
  - Manage face training data (add/remove face examples for people)
  - Trigger model retraining when new faces are tagged
  - Monitor training status and history
  - Critical for face recognition accuracy improvements

### üõ†Ô∏è Platform Development

- [ ] Build React frontend in services/web-app/ with TypeScript
- [ ] Test and improve scan functionality with real photo processing
- [ ] Fix remaining platform tools that have config manager import issues

## üìã Medium Priority

### üîß Technical Improvements
- [ ] Add linting setup and configuration for the platform
- [ ] Add comprehensive API error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement advanced search with filters for objects, faces, dates
- [ ] Add smart album auto-generation based on content analysis
- [ ] Optimize face clustering to use CompreFace recognition for better accuracy

## üìù Notes

- **Documentation Priority**: Always keep documentation website updated with any platform changes
- **Config Issues**: Many platform tools need migration from build imports to direct knex configuration
- **Testing**: Unit test suite is fully functional (93/93 tests passing)
- **Architecture**: Successfully migrated from legacy monolith to platform microservices
